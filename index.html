        <h1 align="center">Latent Tuberculosis</h1>
        <p align="center">Tuberculosis is a disease caused by germs that spread from to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it<br> can also affect other parts of the body. Not everyone infected with TB germs becomes sick.<br> As a result,  2 TB-related conditions occur: latent TB infection (or inactive TB) and TB disease. </p>

    <h3>Signs And Symptoms </h3>
	<p> There are no symptoms associated with Latent TB. You feel normal because the germs inside of you aren't affecting you yet. You also can't give TB to others while having Latent TB.</p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
