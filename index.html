        <h1 align="center">Latent Tuberculosis</h1>
        <p align="center">Tuberculosis is a disease caused by germs that spread from to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it<br> can also affect other parts of the body. Not everyone infected with TB germs becomes sick.<br> As a result,  2 TB-related conditions occur: latent TB infection (or inactive TB) and TB disease. </p>
